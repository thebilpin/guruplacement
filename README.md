4. Management Suite

Right column placeholder feels empty.

Replace with animated mock dashboard preview (progress bar filling, messages pinging).

Keep text on left, visuals on right for balance.

5. RTO Finder

Cards are strong but could highlight trust better:

Add green verified badge on top-right corner.

Include location and course type tags under name.

Use a carousel scroll on mobile.

6. Providers Section

Logos look repetitive.

Add provider photos or city icons for variety.

Give each card slight brand-colored borders to break monotony.

7. Testimonials & Trust

Nice progress, but:

Make testimonials carousel auto-slide.

Add logos of companies beneath quotes for authority.

Include a case study thumbnail preview (click → modal).

8. Integrations

Current icons are clear, but visually light.

Show them in branded colors (Google = red/yellow/blue/green, Slack = purple).

Add short captions: “Email,” “Docs,” “Messaging,” etc.

9. Footer

Much improved. To optimize further:

Add mini sitemap for quick nav.

Place compliance logos (ISO, GDPR) bottom-right.

Newsletter box: increase contrast, maybe gradient highlight.

10. Responsiveness

Mobile:

Role cards should swipe instead of stack.

Hero section headline needs 2-line wrap, not 3.

Tablet:

Stats band should show 2x2 grid instead of 4 in a row.
